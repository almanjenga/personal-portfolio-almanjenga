      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <div class="about-container">

          <p>
            Hi! I’m Alma Mugure, a Bachelor of Science in Informatics and Computer
            Science student at Strathmore University (2022–2026). I focus on software
            engineering and have a growing passion for cybersecurity. I’ve made the
            Dean’s List and enjoy collaborating on projects that create real-world
            impact in my community.
          </p>

          <p>
            Beyond the classroom, I’ve led and served in several roles with AIESEC,
            including Accommodations Manager and Head of Logistics for organizing
            committees. I’ve also worked with @iLabAfrica as a Data Science Intern and
            contributed to community initiatives like Linda Watoto and education
            volunteering in Athi River.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m building products that matter. I developed <em>Eunoia</em>, a mental
            health platform, and I’m working on <em>Tutoria</em>, a peer‑to‑peer learning
            app for Strathmore students. For my final‑year project, I’m researching a
            culturally sensitive NLP‑based menstrual health chatbot tailored for Kenyan
            youth.
          </p>

      <h2>Skills & Technologies</h2>
      <p>
        I enjoy turning ideas into reliable, user‑friendly software. Here are tools and
        technologies I work with regularly:
      </p>
      <ul class="skills-list">
        <li>Programming: Python, Java, Kotlin (Android), JavaScript/TypeScript</li>
        <li>Web & Mobile: React, HTML, CSS, Android (Jetpack)</li>
        <li>Data & ML: Pandas, NumPy, scikit‑learn, basic NLP pipelines</li>
        <li>Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite</li>
        <li>Dev Tools: Git/GitHub, Docker (basics), VS Code</li>
        <li>Practices: REST APIs, testing, agile teamwork</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hobbies, Passions & Goals</h2>
      <p>
        Music keeps me grounded—I play guitar (no capo squad ✊) and I’m part of my
        church’s worship team. I also love mentoring peers, running fun team‑building
        games, and contributing to student communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m passionate about AI for social good, responsible tech, and building tools
        that improve everyday life in Kenya and beyond. Short‑term, I’m sharpening my
        ML and security fundamentals; long‑term, I want to lead engineering teams that
        ship inclusive, privacy‑respecting products.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not coding or practicing guitar, you’ll find me exploring UX ideas,
        learning to play more by ear, and experimenting with small data projects that
        turn curiosity into insight.
